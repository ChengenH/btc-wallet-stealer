# All Ethereum Address (Latest) 

All Ethereum Address Wallet sorted and compressed file's with `.tsv` and `.txt` format for `2023/09`.

All these addresses are required and usable for people who work with huge data, and in this collection that you can see, apart from all the available addresses of Ethereum, there are also two files in .txt and .tsv formats. I have given that, as can be seen from their names, they are sorted by their balance, which is from the address with the balance of the Ethereum wallet from the largest to the smallest. And I have also put a file that is for addresses only, without the balance number of each wallet address, which is suitable for people who work in the field of recovering wallets.

Due to the size limit in Github, I had to split the file into several pieces, which resulted in two 1 GB files and one 339 MB file, which is `2.339 GB` in total.
